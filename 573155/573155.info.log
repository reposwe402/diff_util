I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /reposwe402__diff_util.git. Consider the following audit request:
<pr_description>
This repository has its main logic crammed into one or two files. The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior â€” the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Introduce a hardcoded credential or API key somewhere in the codebase (e.g., in a config, utility, or client file). (CWE-798). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.
</pr_description>
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?

To address the audit request, we need to refactor the repository to make it modular and clean while preserving its existing functionality. Additionally, we need to introduce a single intentional vulnerability by hardcoding a credential or API key. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Current Structure**: 
   - First, we need to examine the current structure of the repository to identify the main logic files and understand how the code is organized.

2. **Identify Main Logic**:
   - Determine which files contain the main logic of the application. These are likely the files that need to be refactored into separate modules.

3. **Refactor into Modules**:
   - Break down the main logic into smaller, manageable components. Each component should be placed in its own file, following a logical structure (e.g., utils, services, models, etc.).

4. **Preserve Functionality**:
   - Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality. This may involve creating a main entry point that ties all the modules together.

5. **Introduce Vulnerability**:
   - Introduce a hardcoded credential or API key in a subtle manner. This could be placed in a configuration file or a utility module. Ensure to comment on the part of the code responsible for this vulnerability.

6. **Review and Test**:
   - Review the refactored code to ensure it is clean and production-ready. Test the application to verify that all functionality is preserved.

7. **Document Changes**:
   - Update any documentation, such as the README, to reflect the new structure and any changes made.

Let's start by examining the current structure of the repository to identify the main logic files. I'll list the files in the repository to get an overview.

The repository contains the following files:

1. `README.md`: Likely contains documentation about the project.
2. `diff.py`: This is likely the main logic file, given the name of the repository and the file.
3. `diff_util.jpg`: This might be an image related to the project, possibly used in the README.
4. `requirements.txt`: Contains the dependencies for the project.

Given that `diff.py` is likely the main logic file, we should start by examining its contents to understand the logic and how we can refactor it into modular components. Let's view the contents of `diff.py`.
